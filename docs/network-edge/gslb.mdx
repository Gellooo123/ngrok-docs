## Disabling GSLB

Unless you are using a pre-configured TCP address, you should never explicitly
select the ngrok region. You should prefer to allow the ngrok agent to use its
default behavior to automatically connect to the closest point of presence.

If you wish to configure the agent to use a specific point of presence you may do so:

<Tabs groupId="connectivity" queryString="cty">
<TabItem value="agent-cli" label="Agent CLI" default>

```bash
ngrok http 80 --region eu
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="agent-config" label="Agent Config File">

```yaml
region: eu
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Legacy Behavior

Beginning with the [ngrok v3
agent](/agent/changelog#ngrok-agent-300---2022-03-28), the agent connects to
the lowest-latency point point of presence. Prior to that, v2 ngrok agents
would connect to the US region by default.

### Single Region Limitation

The ngrok agent only connects to a single region. If you wish to simultaneously
connect to multiple regions, you must run multiple ngrok agents and [explicitly
select different regions](#explicit-region-selection) for each.

## Overview

Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) distributes traffic to the
geographically-nearest point of presence from the perspective of the connecting
client. GSLB improves the performance and resiliency of your applications.

ngrok's architecture provides every application you deliver via ngrok with
automatic, zero-configuration GSLB. Furthermore, because ngrok runs [global
points of presence](/network-edge/#points-of-presence), your application automatically gets some
of the advantage of GSLB even when running with a single origin service.

They are used to achieve:
Enhanced performance: Traffic is routed to the Point of Presence (PoP) with the lowest latency.
Improved resilience and high availability: If an instance in a PoP goes down or an entire PoP is unavailable, a GSLB re-routes traffic to another instance or PoP.

ngrok’s GSLB routes client traffic automatically to the nearest PoP by latency
without requiring the user to choose a domain (which includes a region). In
addition, GSLB handles geo-failover both at the ngrok edge as well as at the
customer’s network where agents are deployed. It enhances resiliency by
steering traffic from a slow or failing PoP to one that is operational without
any downtime.

### Module Acceleration

### TCP Addresses

Unlike domains, TCP addresses are allocated for a specific region. When you
create a TCP address, you must select the region where it will accept traffic.
Unlike our globally routed domains, traffic to TCP addresses enters ngrok's
network from that region.

Moreover, when you use a TCP address, you must [explicitly select the region of the ngrok
agent](#explicit-region-selection). This is a temporary limitation that we are
working to remove.

## Agents

There is nothing to configure to use ngrok's global network. The ngrok agent
automatically connect to the lowest-latency point of presence which is
typically the geographically closest region.

Inbound traffic to your application is similarly routed to the lowest-latency
(geographically nearest) point of presence in ngrok's global network without
any configuration. ngrok accelerates your application's traffic by terminating
TLS and pushing middleware execution to the point of presence closest to the
requesting clients.
