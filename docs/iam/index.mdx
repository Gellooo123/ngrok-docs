## Overview

An ngrok **Account** is the container in which you create and consume ngrok
services.

An Account contains one or more **Users**. Users are members of the Account who
can take actions within it, like creating objects, start agents or making API
requests.

Accounts also contain **Bot Users** which are like Users but meant to be used for
automated processes.

Users and Bot Users may begin Agent sessions by authenticating with an
**Authtoken** or make API requests authenticated with an **API Key**.

Users (but not Bot Users) may log into the dashboard. You may configure your
account to restrict how users authenicate to the dashboard. ngrok supports
dashboard authentication via an email and password, an IdP like GitHub or
Google or your own Single Sign-On IdP like Okta or Azure AD.

Users are added to your account via **Invitations**, just-in-time provisioning
with an SSO IdP, or an IdP's SCIM integration.

ngrok includes Role Based Access Control which allows you to restrict what
actions Users and Bot Users may take within your account.

If you are an Enterprise customer, you have the option of enabling Single
Sign-On (SSO) for your users logging into the ngrok Dashboard. Account admins
can find the configuration options under the ["Settings >
Account"](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/settings) in the left navigation once
they log into the dashboard.

You also have the option to choose how new users are added to the account. If
you'd like new users to automatically be provisioned in the account when they
log in, you can enable Just in Time (JiT) provisioning. This allows users to be
added to your account when using the link from the identity provider. If you'd
rather only allow invited users to join, you can select "Invite Only" which
will require new users to be invited through the teams page before being added
to the account.
